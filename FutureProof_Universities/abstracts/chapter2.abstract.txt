This chapter examines the financial realities facing American higher education, exploring why college costs have risen faster than nearly all other sectors of the economy. Using William Bowen's concept of "cost disease," the analysis demonstrates how labor-intensive educational institutions resist the efficiency gains typical of other industries. Through case studies of Yale University and liberal arts colleges, the chapter reveals that even at institutions charging $85,000 annually, tuition covers only a fraction of actual educational costs, which can exceed $130,000 per student. The chapter analyzes the role of endowments in institutional stability, noting that while elite institutions hold billions in assets, median endowments provide minimal operating support. Various revenue diversification strategies are examined, including international student recruitment, summer programs, post-baccalaureate offerings, campus partnerships, and intellectual property licensing. The analysis addresses critical questions about the sustainability of traditional higher education structures, including tenure, departmental organization, and residential learning models. While acknowledging the urgent need for business model reform, the chapter argues that purely cost-focused approaches risk sacrificing the intangible benefits — transformative encounters, mentorship, and intellectual community — that makes higher education valuable to society.
