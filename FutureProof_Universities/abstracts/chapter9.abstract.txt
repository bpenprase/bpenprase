Higher education faces existential challenges: a broken financial model, mounting student debt, declining enrollments from the looming demographic cliff, and dozens of institutional closures annually. This chapter argues that universities must transform from "organized anarchy" into entrepreneurial learning organizations to survive. Drawing lessons from diverse institutional models—Arizona State's "Fifth Wave" transformation, startup universities like Olin College and Minerva, mega-universities including Western Governors and Southern New Hampshire, and innovative global institutions from Africa to Asia—the chapter identifies key strategies for building future-proof universities. These include creative revenue diversification, disaggregated faculty roles, competency-based education, and innovation centers that catalyze campus-wide change. The chapter emphasizes AI's emergence as "co-intelligence" that should extend rather than replace human thinking, guided by frameworks emphasizing curiosity, intentionality, and care. Four detailed institutional concepts are presented: a model for the New Liberal Arts College synthesizing global innovations, MIT's New Educational Institution with its teaching-focused faculty model, a modular university system enabling mission-focused specialization, and AI-enabled learning platforms like Matter and Space. The future-proof university will combine technological efficiency with human-centered values, delivering accessible, affordable, transformative education while preserving the essential "minds rubbing against minds" that residential communities provide. The longer-term future of education in the age of AI is also considered by considering the potential of a renaissance of learning powered by ethical and thoughtful uses of AI in education.
