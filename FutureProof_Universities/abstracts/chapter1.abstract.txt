This chapter examines the mounting challenges facing US higher education while introducing a framework for institutional renewal. Despite predictions of imminent collapse, the sector has proven resilient yet faces serious structural problems: a broken business model marked by skyrocketing tuition, declining public support, a "demographic cliff" threatening future enrollment, and administrative cost pressures. The chapter documents the paradox of enduring value — bachelor's degrees still yield significant lifetime earnings premiums—alongside growing inequities that concentrate benefits at elite institutions while hundreds of smaller colleges face closure or merger. The analysis identifies key dysfunctions including prestige-driven governance paralysis, misalignment between educational offerings and student needs, and declining completion rates. However, the chapter argues these challenges create opportunities for innovation. It previews solutions explored throughout the book: entrepreneurial approaches to university management, new start-up institutions serving underrepresented populations globally, teaching innovations at research universities, the rise of mega-universities delivering value at scale, artificial intelligence integration, and reimagined residential learning models. The chapter concludes by envisioning a "future-proof university" that combines the transformative elements of traditional liberal arts education with technological efficiency, accessibility, and adaptability to an AI-permeated world.
