This chapter examines the global emergence of new universities in the 21st century, arguing that startup institutions are essential for pioneering innovations in curriculum, pedagogy, and institutional mission that legacy universities struggle to achieve. While the United States faces a stagnant higher education ecosystem—with more campuses closing than opening and steep accreditation barriers limiting new entrants—notable exceptions like Olin College, Soka University of America, and Minerva University demonstrate transformative possibilities. The chapter contrasts this with dramatic expansion across Asia, where China's tertiary enrollment has grown tenfold to over 41 million students and India added 2,400 new institutions in a single year. Particular attention is given to the Global South, which represents over 85 percent of the world's population and where institutions like African Leadership University, Ashesi University, African Leadership University, and the Asian University for Women are addressing urgent needs for scalable, affordable education, women's empowerment, and entrepreneurial leadership. The chapter highlights how new liberal arts universities in Pakistan, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh are grounding curricula in local cultural traditions while preparing graduates for global engagement. These startup institutions collectively offer a blueprint for the "future-proof" university.
