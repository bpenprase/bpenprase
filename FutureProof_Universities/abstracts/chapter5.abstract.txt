America's top research universities—including MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Caltech, UC Berkeley, Yale, and Georgetown—are increasingly directing their world-class talent toward transforming undergraduate education through innovative interdisciplinary centers. Drawing on organizational theory from Christensen, Garvin, and Senge, these "protected innovation spaces" operate outside traditional departmental constraints, enabling cross-disciplinary collaboration between cognitive scientists, computer scientists, and educational researchers. Notable examples include MIT's Media Lab and Open Learning initiative (creators of SCRATCH and OpenCourseWare), Harvard's Bok Center and Initiative for Learning and Teaching, Stanford's d.school and Digital Education programs, Caltech's CTLO and SURF undergraduate research programs, UC Berkeley's Discovery Initiative, Yale's Poorvu Center, and Georgetown's Red House. These centers have achieved remarkable national and global impact: MIT's OpenCourseWare has received over 500 million visits, SCRATCH has reached 103 million users across 70 languages, and MIT's MicroMasters credentials are accepted by 93 graduate programs worldwide. As training grounds for doctoral students who will become tomorrow's professors, these centers shape not only current pedagogical practice but also the future of higher education. The chapter concludes by noting the challenge of scaling these innovations beyond individual centers to systematically transform institutions and ensure these advances benefit all of higher education.
