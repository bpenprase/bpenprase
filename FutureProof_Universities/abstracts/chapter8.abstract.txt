This chapter argues that residential living-learning communities represent one of higher education's most powerful yet underutilized tools for transformative learning. Drawing on decades of research from scholars including Astin, Pascarella and Terenzini, Kuh, and Chambliss and Takacs, the chapter demonstrates that where students live profoundly shapes what they learn—with residence halls functioning as central educational sites rather than peripheral amenities. The chapter examines how high-impact practices identified by AAC&U, including first-year seminars, undergraduate research, service learning, and capstone projects, can be intentionally woven into residential environments. After reviewing best practices from elite institutions such as Yale, Princeton, and selective liberal arts colleges, the chapter explores innovative models that deliver exceptional residential education at reduced cost: Honors Colleges providing intimate learning within large research universities, work colleges eliminating tuition through student labor, Minerva University's global rotation across world cities, and the Greenway Institute's 2+2 model combining intensive on-campus learning with paid professional experience. The chapter concludes that synthesizing these innovations—integrating academic and student affairs, leveraging student labor, and reimagining the traditional four-year residential model—can make transformative residential education accessible to far more students.
