Universities face unprecedented existential threats from demographic decline and unsustainable cost structures, yet these institutions remain remarkably resistant to change. This chapter examines the paradox of higher education: institutions that simultaneously preserve historical knowledge while building futures, constrained by centuries-old traditions and what Cohen and March termed "organized anarchy." Drawing on business management frameworks including Porter's Five Forces and Christensen's disruption theory, the chapter analyzes competitive pressures reshaping academia—from mega-universities achieving unprecedented scale through digital delivery to alternative credentials threatening traditional degree pathways. Arizona State University under Michael Crow emerges as a transformative example, demonstrating that universities can fundamentally reinvent themselves through bold leadership, interdisciplinary innovation, and "Blue Ocean" strategies. The chapter synthesizes organizational culture theories from Schein, Greiner, and Senge to propose pathways toward building "learning organizations" capable of adaptive change. Through case studies of Mills College, Hampshire College, and Sweet Briar College — institutions that navigated near-closure through strategic reinvention — the chapter identifies essential elements for institutional survival: cultural entrepreneurship, community mobilization, and fundamental reconsideration of institutional purpose. The analysis concludes that higher education's future depends on developing entrepreneurial cultures that balance tradition with transformation.
