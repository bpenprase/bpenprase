This chapter examines the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on higher education, tracing AI's development from its theoretical origins in the 1940s through the current era of large language models. The chapter explores how modern AI systems work, including neural networks, transformers, and attention mechanisms that enable sophisticated language processing. It surveys the emerging field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), highlighting intelligent tutoring systems like MATHia and ALEKS that personalize learning through cognitive modeling, as well as AI tools designed to promote human collaboration and creativity rather than simply provide answers. The chapter presents theoretical frameworks from leading scholars including Ethan Mollick, Jose Antonio Bowen, Joseph Aoun, and Bryan Alexander, who advocate for "co-intelligence" approaches where AI augments rather than replaces human thinking. It profiles pioneering AI-focused institutions including the Roux Institute, Mohammed bin Zayed University of AI, and the Jio Institute, alongside dedicated AI centers at major research universities. Throughout, the chapter emphasizes the critical importance of maintaining human-centered approaches, developing AI literacy and ethical frameworks, and preserving meaningful human interactions as AI becomes increasingly integrated into educational practice.
